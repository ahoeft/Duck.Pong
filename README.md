# This simple program was created using duck ai.  I will document the prompts and record the results here.


## Using html, javascript, and css can you make me a pong game?



The ai produced some interesting results.  We have a functioning game out the bat with one player controlled paddle and one computer operated one that seems to impossible to score against.

## Can you add a score board that tracks the computers score and my score?

Well it added a scoreboard but it doesn't seem to be tracking at all
