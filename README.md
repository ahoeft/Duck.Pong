# This simple program was created using duck ai.  I will document the prompts and record the results here.


## Using html, javascript, and css can you make me a pong game?



The ai produced some interesting results.  We have a functioning game out the bat with one player controlled paddle and one computer operated one that seems to impossible to score against.

## Can you add a score board that tracks the computers score and my score?

Well it added a scoreboard but it doesn't seem to be tracking at all

## The computer seems really hard to score against, anyway we can make that easier?

The ai had this to say which made me chuckle: "Sure! Making the computer easier to score against in your Pong game can enhance the enjoyment. Below, I will provide you with a modified code snippet that makes the computer paddle less responsive."

The computer still seems to be impossible to score against however the scoreboard looks much nicer now and it properly displaying the computers score dunking on me.

## Lets add a start screen that will have a start game button 

Ai responded with: "Here's a complete Pong game in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a scoreboard, adjustable AI difficulty, and a start screen with a "Start Game" button. You can easily copy and paste this code into an HTML file to play the game."

The ai responded with "adjustable AI difficulty" which isn't something I asked for but was thinking about asking for next.  Not sure if this was an inference or a hallucination.

Results:  Maybe there is a text limitation from Duck.Ai.  It seems the code cuts off after line 124 which meant it was missing the closing script, body, and html tags.  In addition it seems to have removed the event listener which was controlling the player paddle.  Its way of making the game easier isn't really working either.  The ball moves to slow for the slightly slower paddle to matter and the computer is still impossible to beat.
