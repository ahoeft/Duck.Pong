# This simple program was created using duck ai.  I will document the prompts and record the results here.


## Using html, javascript, and css can you make me a pong game?



The ai produced some interesting results.  We have a functioning game out the bat with one player controlled paddle and one computer operated one that seems to impossible to score against.

## Can you add a score board that tracks the computers score and my score?

Well it added a scoreboard but it doesn't seem to be tracking at all

## The computer seems really hard to score against, anyway we can make that easier?

The ai had this to say which made me chuckle: "Sure! Making the computer easier to score against in your Pong game can enhance the enjoyment. Below, I will provide you with a modified code snippet that makes the computer paddle less responsive."

The computer still seems to be impossible to score against however the scoreboard looks much nicer now and it properly displaying the computers score dunking on me.
